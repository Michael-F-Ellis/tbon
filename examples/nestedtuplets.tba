/* c4 \tuplet 5/4 { f8 e f \tuplet 3/2 { e[ f g] } } f4 */

/* which can be rendered exactly in tbon as ... */

   ^c f-----e-----f-- ---e---f---g--- f |

/* We can also get the same result by adjusting the tempo */
/*   and combining the middle two beats into one */

    c t=0.5 f--e--f--e-f-g- t=1.0 f |
